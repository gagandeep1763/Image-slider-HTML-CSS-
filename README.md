# Image Slider

![Output](https://github.com/gagandeep1763/Image-slider-HTML-CSS-/raw/main/Output.png)

This is a simple image slider project built using only HTML and CSS. 
It displays a row of images, and when the user hovers over any image, that image expands smoothly to draw attention while the others shrink. 
The project demonstrates how hover effects and transitions can be used to create interactive UI components without any JavaScript.

## Overview

The slider contains five images aligned horizontally using flexbox. On hover, the width of the image increases with a smooth transition effect. 
The design is responsive and easy to customize with your own images or styling.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project folder.

2. Make sure the images (`image1.jpeg` to `image5.jpeg`) are present in the same directory as `index.html`.

3. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.

4. Hover over the images to see the sliding effect.

## Files Included

- `index.html` – HTML structure for the image slider.
- `style.css` – CSS styles for layout and hover animations.
- `image1.jpeg` to `image5.jpeg` – Sample images used in the slider.
